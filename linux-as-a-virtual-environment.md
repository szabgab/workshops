This is the first event in our DevOps series lead by Yonit Gruber-Hazani ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonitgruber/) and Gabor Szabo ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/ ). We start with the basics. Installing and starting to use Linux. Many of the upcoming events will assume you already know at least the basics of Linux. So don't skip this one.

* Setting up Linux in a Virtual environment on your own computer.
* Learning the basics of Linux.

This is a hands-on event. You will hear a short demo and presentation and then you will install Linux and start using it.

Bring your own computer!

In order to speed up the installation please

Make sure you have at least 10 Gb free space on your hard disk after you have downloaded and installed the above.
