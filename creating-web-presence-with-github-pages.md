# Creating web presence with GitHub pages

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a very easy way to start building content-heavy web sites and host them free of charge. It allows you to write your pages in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and then converts them to HTML using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

In this hands-on workshop we will explore the world of GitHub pages and Jekyll. You will build your own web site hosted on GitHub.

As this is a hands-on workshop you will need to bring your own computer with your favorite text editor installed on it.
You will need to have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and you'll have to have a git client on your computer.


You don't need a domain name, but if you have one, make sure you have the credentials to change the configuration of its
DNS service. That will allow us to map one of the hostnames of your domain to use the github pages. Similar to how
http://workshops.code-maven.com/ and http://github.szabgab.com/ work.


Some of the tasks we would like to tackle

* Create a simple index page
* Link a hostname of your domain to the page. (if you have a domain)
* Create a second page and link them together
* Select a theme
* Set the title of the page
* Creat a menu for navigation
* Include our owm CSS to fine-tune the theme
* Include our onw JavaScript to provide some client-side interaction
* Use a JSON file to provide data for the client-side interaction
* Include common files in the pages
