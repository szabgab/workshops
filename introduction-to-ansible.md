Ansible is an Configuration Management tool written in Python that makes it easy to automate application and IT infrastructure. It can handle maintenance of hundreds or thousands of servers grouped by their role. It can help with Application Deployment and Continuous Deployment. It is one of the most popular tools for modern CM.

At this workshop we are going to help you get started with Ansible. We will start by installing the tool and then we are going to configure several Linux boxes in the cloud.

Please bring your own computer with Linux running on it either natively or in a virtual environment such as VirtualBox.

This is part of our DevOps series lead by Yonit Gruber-Hazani ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonitgruber/) and Gabor Szabo ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/ ).
