# Getting Started with Google Cloud

* Date: 2019.06.20 18:00-21:00
* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/events/261872508/)
* Location: [Twiggle](https://twiggle.com/), Yigal Alon 96, Tel Aviv

The [Google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) is big and it might be intimidating to get started.

In this workshop we'll do our first step starting by creating an account. We plan to do the following:


* Create an account (Google gives you some free usage, but you'll need your international credit card for this)
* Get familiar with the [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
* Create a Virtual Machine VM Instance (just a Linux box in the cloud).
* Install the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and use it to ssh to the server.
* Set up Metadata to create accounts on the VMs.
* Learn about preemptable and regular instances.
* Create our own image with some preinstalled software and configuration.
* Create instance template.
* Create instance group.

This is a hands-on workshop. It will include presentation and you actually experimenting with it.


## Prerequisite:

* You need to bring your computer. Preferably with Linux or OSX or with Linux running in a VirtualBox.
* An international credit card.
