# Image manipulation with Python PIL and Pillow

PIL is the Python Imaging Library. [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a friendly fork of PIL.

The image that you can see on the home page of the Code Maven workshop was taken by yours truly at one of our early
workshop. Then it was changed using PIL to have its current form.
(Well, actually originally it was changed using Gimp, but since I learned I can do it better using PIL.)

In this workshop we will learn a number of techniques you can use to create and change images programmatically.
Some of the tasks you'll accomplish during the workshop.

* Create an image with a single color background and text on it that can be posted on social networks to grab the
  attention of people.
* Add straight lines to existing imagas to mark specific areas.
* Add rectangulars to image to mark objects.
* Resize image.
* Crop image.
* Blur image.
* Add a white triangle at the bottom of the image and write some text on it.
* Draw simple pictures.
