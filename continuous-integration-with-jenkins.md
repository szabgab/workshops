# Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Jenkins is the most popular Continuous Integration System. It is actually more than just a CI system. It allows you to create pipelines that start by a trigger from your version control system, building your software, creating artifacts, testing the software, and even automatically deploying it.

In this Workshop you will hear a presentation introducing Jenkins with a few use-cases. Then you are going to install Jenkins on your computer in a Virtual Linux environment or on a Linux server in the cloud. You will experiment with a few scenarios that can be easily implemented using Jenkins.

You'll need to bring your own computer. You are expected to have basic experience using Linux.
