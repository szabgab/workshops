# Continuous Integration with Jenkins

* 2018.05.29 16:00-19:00
* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/events/246910783/)
* [Google Campus](https://www.campus.co/tel-aviv/en) in Tel Aviv

Jenkins is the most popular Continuous Integration System. It is actually more than just a CI system. It allows you to create pipelines that start by a trigger from your version control system, building your software, creating artifacts, testing the software, and even automatically deploying it.

In this Workshop you will hear a presentation introducing Jenkins with a few use-cases. Then you are going to install Jenkins on your computer in a Virtual Linux environment or on a Linux server in the cloud. You will experiment with a few scenarios that can be easily implemented using Jenkins.

You'll need to bring your own computer. You are expected to have basic experience using Linux.

Part of our DevOps series lead by Yonit Gruber-Hazani ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/yonitgruber/) and Gabor Szabo ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/szabgab/ ).
