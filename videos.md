# Why use pre-recorded presentations?

* They allow each participant to *progress at their own pace*: Double the speed of the video if it is too slow, or go back a few minutes to
  rewatch the part that was not clear the first time. All this without being worried that they are bothering the others.

* They allow *people at different levels of knowledge* to attend the workshop. This is especially important with subjects that need
  several meetings. For example, without the pre-recorded videos when we organized the "2nd part of the Git
  workshop" that limited the participants very much to those who participated in the first part. With the pre-recorded
  videos we can have an "Introducation to Git" and both people with no background in and people who already made some progress can
  participate. Each one of them will find the right part of the video series mathching their current level.

* Allow people to *jump around in the material*. Instaed of going sequentially, people can pick the sub-topics that are
  especially interesting to them.

* Some people might arrive already with some background in the subject. They might want to *skip some of the videos* and
  go straight to the areas new to them.

* They allow me to provide the *presentations in more than one language* (Hebrew and English for now) and each person can listen to the preferred version.

* Gives me more time to go around, *more time to help each one of the participants*, answer questions.

* It also *makes it easier for the participants to ask questions* as this is not in the open forum of all the other people.
  Especially it provides an opportunity for people who are less keen on talking in-front of other people to ask question.

* Finally, having the videos recorded will allow others as well, for a small fee, to watch the videos even if they
  cannot come to the workshops. *Watch from anywhere at any time*.
