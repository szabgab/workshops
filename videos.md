# Why use pre-recorded presentations?

* They allow each participant to progress at their own pace: Double the speed of the video if it is too slow, or go back a few minutes to
  rewatch the part that was not clear the first time. All this without being worried that they are bothering the others.

* They allow people at different levels to attend the workshop. This is especially important with subjects that need
  several meetings. For example, without the pre-recorded videos I could not really organize the "2nd part of the Git
  workshop" as that would limit the participants very much to those who participated in the first part. This way we can
  have an "Introducation to Git" and both people with no background in and people who already made some progress can
  participate. Each one of them will find the right part of the video series mathching their current level.

* They allow me to provide the presentations in more than one language (Hebrew and English for now) and each person can listen to the preferred version.

* Gives me more time to go around, help each one of the participants, answer questions.

* That also makes it easier for the participants to ask questions as this is not in the open forum of all the other people.
