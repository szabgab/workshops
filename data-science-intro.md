# Getting Started with Data Science for non-programmers

This workshop will help you get started with Data Sciences even if you have minimal or no programming background.
We'll take a simple data set and see how can we start analyzing it. You will get the tools to start on your journey
to Data Science.

In more technical terms we will

* Install Python, Jupyter Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
* Read in some CSV file (and maybe also a JSON file).
* Make some simple filtering and transformation on the data.
* Create some simple graphs.


Data Science is a huge world, we will only have a taste during this workshop, but this is a hands-on workshop you
seeing a demo you will get your hands dirty with the tools.

This workshop is based on (a very small part of) the "Programming Bootcamp for Scientists" I run in the Weizmann Institute of Science.

Requirement:

Bring your own computer.
