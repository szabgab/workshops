* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/292821156/)

* What is "GitHub Pages"?
    * Create a static site from Markdown files in a branch. (Use the main branch and the `docs/` subfolder) Use https://github.com/cm-demo for this
        * New repository `cm-demo.github.io`  / Public / Add README
        * Settings / Pages (no need to do anything)
        * Visit https://cm-demo.github.io/

        * Create `docs/index.md` file
        * Settings / Pages
        * Visit https://cm-demo.github.io/

    * User your own subdomain
        * Visit https://workshops.code-maven.com/
        * It's source is as https://github.com/szabgab/workshops
        * It is in the / folder (not `/docs`)
        * CNAME  + DNS mapping at https://iwantmyname.com/
        * _config.yml  (theme etc.)
        * _layouts

        * Visit https://szabgab.github.io/ (it redirects to https://github.szabgab.com/ )
        

    * Convert it to a site generated by GitHub Actions Jekyll
