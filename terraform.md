# Infrastrucutre as Code with Terraform


[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is one of the leading technologies used under the title <b>Infrastructure as Code</b>.

* How can you set up a Google Cloud Instance (or Amazon EC2) from the command line?
* How can track the changes to your infrastructure in the cloud?
* How can you allow others in your company to change certain parts of your cloud environment without risking they will
  have negative impact on the rest of your system?


In software we are used to use Version Control systems for everythin. Recent years saw the surge of tools that help us
track the changes we make to the configurations of our servers. (e.g. Ansible, Chef, Puppet provide solutions for this.)

Terraform helps you track the changes you make to the infrastructure.

e.g. You add more memory to a server. You add a new element to a cluster.


In this workshop we'll start to explore Terraform.

You will need to bring your own computer. It will be a good idea to have Linux or OSX on it either natively or in a
VirtualBox. You'll also need to have accounts on the various cloud services. You might need an international credit card
to sign up to some of the services, if you don't have an account yet.
