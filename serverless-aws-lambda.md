# Serverless AWS Lambda

* 2018.06.25 16:00-19:00

* [Cellebrite](https://www.cellebrite.com/) in Petach Tikva

"Serverless" or FaaS (Functions as a Service) means that you don't need to worry about the configuration and maintenance of the servers where your code runs. You "only" write the code and you can deploy individual functions with API calls.

AWS Lambda is the serverless platform Amazon provides. It supports Node.js, Python, Java, C#, and Go.

In this workshop you'll create your first serverless application running on AWS Lambda.

You will need to bring your own computer. You are expected to have experience with either of the languages supported by Lambda.
