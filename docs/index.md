## Host a workshop

Would you like to [host](host) a Code-Maven workshop?

## About the Code-Maven Workshops

Code Maven Workshops are short, 3-4-hours meetings with a mix or presentations and hands-on exercises to learn tools, technologies, and processes used in the world of Development,
Testing, Operations, and DevOps. They can be provided in-house at your company as a morning or afternoon half-day session.
Ocassionally they are also run via the [Code-Mavens at Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Code-Mavens/)  group in which case they can usually be attended free of charge. Below you'll see the dates
and locations of the previous events.

## Courses

In addition to the 3-4-hours long workshops Gabor also provides full-length [training courses](https://hostlocal.com/) in these
subject. Check out the list of currently available courses and let me know if you are interested in either of those or
something in a related subject.
