# Workshop

This is (also) the continuation of our previous meetings, but newcomers are welcome as well. This is a self-learning course so you can always start from the beginning. This time however, we'll already have some advanced material as well.

In this series of meetings we are learning the Python Programming language. If you don't have a Code Maven Pro subscription, then during the workshop you'll get temporary access to the video presentations recorded by Gabor that are hosted at https://he.code-maven.com/python (currently they are available in Hebrew only) You'll get exercises and tasks to do. The videos go over (part of) the slides hosted here: https://code-maven.com/slides/python-programming/

During the workshop Gabor will go around and help each one of the participants.

Check out for an explanation in Hebrew: https://he.code-maven.com/workshops and in English: https://workshops.code-maven.com/videos

The meetings of the series will take place once a week or once every 2 weeks depending on the availability of the venue.


## Prerequisites / Requirements

* As each person can start at any place in the course and everyone can make progress at their own pace. This series of meeting will fit you even if you do NOT have any prior programming knowledge. It will also fit if you already have some experience.
* This is a workshop, you must bring your computer.
* You must bring earphones/headphones to listen to the videos.
* You need to have a (free) account on the [Code-Maven](https://code-maven.com/) web site.
* If you are using MS Windows, it is a good idea to download [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* Watch [the explanation](https://he.code-maven.com/workshops)

### If you are planning to learn Python:

* If you are using MS Windows, it is a good idea to download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) before the meeting, but you can leave the installation to the meeting.

## How long will this Python course take?

It depends a lot on your background and how fast you can absorb the new material. It is very individual. I'd say you need 30-100 hours to handle the beginner part of it. The advanced part is probably of similar length. Then there will be special areas (e.g. web application development) that will add more time.

## Who is this Gabor?

Your host and mentor, a long time developer and sysadmin (shall I say DevOps?) who has been running training courses since 2000.
He wrote and recorded almost all the content of the [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) site and the [Hebrew Code Maven](https://he.code-maven.com/) site.

## Pricing

* The usual price of such workshop for my corporate clients is about 500-700 NIS + VAT / person.
* The price of subscribing to the Code Maven Pro (to gain access to all the videos) is $9 / month or $90 / year, but currently it only works if you contact me personally.
* This specific event is FREE of charge and it is especially aimed at people who's workplace does not finance such courses.

## Food and refreshment

Some people seem to expect that along the knowledge they also get food free of charge at Meetups so let me clarify: There is no food or refreshment provided at this workshop.

## Access

* The Google campus is about 8-10 min walk from the "HaShalom" train station.
* Parking on the streets is not easy, however you can park in the Electra building. Starting from 16:00 if you bring and stamp your ticket at the entrance of the campus the cost will be 15 NIS.
