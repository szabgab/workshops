# Creating Jenkins pipeline without any coding

Jenkins is the most popular Open source automation system. It has a traditional mode in which you write stand alone
script in various languages and it has a relatively new pipeline mode.

The pipelines allow you to do a lot of thing by themselves and you can extend them with Groovy script and can also
call any other external programs.

In this workshop we will learn about the capabilities of the Jenkins pipelines without writing a line of Groovy, Bash,
Perl, or Python code.

Just the pipelines and the plugins of Jenkins.

This is a hands-on workshop. You must bring your computer to be able to do the task. Although Jenkins can run on Windows as well it seems to prefer Linux.  So It is a good idea to have working
Linux system on your computer. Either native or inside a VirtualBox environment.
