# Jenkins pipeline with Groovy code

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is the most popular Open source automation system. It has a traditional mode in which you write stand alone
script in various languages and it has a relatively new pipeline mode.

The pipelines allow you to do a lot of thing by themselves and you can extend them with [Groovy](http://groovy-lang.org/) script and can also
call any other external programs.

In this workshop we will use the least possible pipeline structure and will use exclusively Groovy to automate tasks.

This is a hands-on workshop. You must bring your computer to be able to do the task. Although Jenkins can run on Windows as well it seems to prefer Linux.  So It is a good idea to have working
Linux system on your computer. Either native or inside a VirtualBox environment.
