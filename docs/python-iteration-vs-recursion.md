# Python pair programming - iteration vs recursion

In this event we'll give a presentation about solving problems with iterative algorithm vs recursive algorithm
to see which situation is better suited by one or the other.

Then you'll get tasks related to the topic that you'll solve in pairs practising both python and pair programming.
