# GitHub Actions to generate complex static web sites


* [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/292821156/)

## What are "GitHub Pages"?

* Create a static site from Markdown files in a branch. (Use the main branch and the `docs/` subfolder) Use https://github.com/cm-demo for this
    * New repository `cm-demo.github.io`  / Public / Add README
    * Settings / Pages (no need to do anything)
    * Visit https://cm-demo.github.io/

    * We can see the process in the [actions](https://github.com/cm-demo/cm-demo.github.io/actions) entry

    * Settings / Pages /
        * Source: Deploy from branch
        * Branch: main , `/docs`
    * Create `docs/index.md` file
    * Visit https://cm-demo.github.io/

* User your own subdomain
    * Visit https://workshops.code-maven.com/
    * It's source is as https://github.com/szabgab/workshops
    * It is in the `/docs` folder. There are some other things outside. (code generating banners for Meetup, thumbnails for the YouTube videos)
    * CNAME
    * DNS mapping at https://iwantmyname.com/
    * `_config.yml`  (theme etc.)
    * `_layouts`
