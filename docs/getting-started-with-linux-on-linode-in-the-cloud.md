# Getting started with Linux on Linode in the cloud for less than 1 cent

Most services are deployed on a Linux machine and while some developers can still get by without it, knowing Linux to some extent will give you a lot of power.

Both on the job and while looking for a job.Installing Linux on your computer is not a huge issue, but it is way easier to set up a server in the cloud and use that.
It is also quite cheap.

Specifically on Linode you can get a machine for less than 1 cent an hour.

At the end of every learning session you can turn it off, but even if you forget to turn it off it is till only $5 a month.

Hopefully this isn't want will make you bankrupt.
