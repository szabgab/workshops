# Introduction to Linux (in a Docker container)

We'll start with a presentation introducing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),
installing a Linux image and learning the basics of the Linux Shell.

Then you will get tasks to do in Linux. You'll work in pairs to accomplish the goals.

The focus of this meeting is the Linux shell, Docker is only used as a tool to make it easy to run Linux on a Windows-based computer.

* You must bring your computer!
* It is recommended that you install Docker before the meeting: For Windows [check here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
