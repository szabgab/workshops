# Getting Started with Digital Ocean

[Digital Ocean](http://code-maven.com/digitalocean) started out as low cost and very simple VPS provider
and grew at a terrific pace. Today it already provides a number of additional services that you
get from various Cloud providers.

In this workshop you'll learn and practice how to get started with some of the services Digital Ocean provides.

You'll need to have an international Credit Card with you as for the registration you'll need to provide it.

This is a hands-on workshop. You must bring your computer to be able to do the task.
It does not need to have anything special on it.
