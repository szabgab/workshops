# Jenkins pipeline with Groovy code

Jenkins is the most popular Open source autmation system. It has a traditional mode in which you write stand alons
script in various languages and it has a relatively new pipeline mode.

The pipelines allow you to do a lot of thing by themselves and you can extend them with Groovy script and can also
call any other external programs.

In this workshop we will use the least possible pipeline structure and will use exclusively Groovy to automate tasks.

This is a hands-on workshop. You must bring your computer to be able to do the task. Although Jenkins can run on Windows as well it seems to prefer Linux.  So It is a good idea to have working
Linux system on your computer. Either native or inside a VirtualBox environment.

The workshop is lead by Gabor Szabo who also maintains the Code Maven web site https://code-maven.com/ and teaches training courses https://hostlocal.com/ in many different subjects related to programming, testing, operations, and DevOps.
