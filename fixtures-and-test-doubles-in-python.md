Writing tests is a great way to improve the quality of your application, but in a complex application that depends on various 3rd party APIs it can be quite hard.

Pytest makes it easier.

In this workshop will have a quick view on what are fixtures and how to use them in Pytest.

We'll also look at Mocks, Spies, Stubs, Fakes, and Dummies that are all various types of Test Doubles. We'll see a number of use-cases and implementations.

You will get various cases where you'll need to use the above ideas and tools to test the code.


This is a hands-on workshop. You must bring your computer to be able to do the task. It does not need to have anything special on it just Python, some editor you like, and a Git client.

The workshop is lead by Gabor Szabo who also maintains the [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) web site and teaches [training courses](https://hostlocal.com/) in many different subjects related to programming, testing, operations, and DevOps.
